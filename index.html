             <dl><dt><b><u><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantle_(geology)">MANTLE</a></u></dt><dd></dd></dl>
            <ul><li>mantle is the thick layer of the earth beneath its outer crust.The mantile is semi solid and generally divided into an upper and lower mantle </li></ul><br>
            <dl><dt><b><u><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_inner_core">INNER CORE</a> </u></b></dt></dl>
            <u><li> The inner core is the fourth layer inside the Earth. It is a solid metallic ball made mainly of iron. Here, temperatures reach extraordinary levels, estimated to be between 7,200–8,500ºF (4,000–4,700ºC). Although the inner core is very hot, it is not liquid like the outer core.</li></ul><br>
            <dl><dt><b><u><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_crust>CRUST</a></u></b></dt></dl>
            <ul><li>“Crust” describes the outermost shell of a terrestrial planet. Earth's crust is generally divided into older, thicker continental crust and younger, denser oceanic crust. The dynamic geology of Earth's crust is informed by plate tectonics</li></ul><br>
            <dl><dt><b><u><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_outer_core>OUTER CORE</a> </u></b></dt></dl>
            <ul><li>The outer core is the third layer of the Earth. It is the only liquid layer, and is mainly made up of the metals iron and nickel, as well as small amounts of other substances. The outer core is responsible for Earth's magnetic field. As Earth spins on its axis, the iron inside the liquid outer core moves around.
</li></ul><br>
            <dl><dt><b><u><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithosphere">LITHOSPHERE</a></u></b></dt></dl>
            <ul><li>The lithosphere is the solid, outer part of Earth. The lithosphere includes the brittle upper portion of the mantle and the crust, the outermost layers of Earth's structure. It is bounded by the atmosphere above and the asthenosphere (another part of the upper mantle) below.</li></ul></br>
            <dl><dt><b><u><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asthenosphere">ASTHENOSPHERE</a></u></b></dt></dl>
            <ul><li>What is the Asthenosphere? The asthenosphere is a semi-fluid layer located in the upper part of the Earth's mantle, situated beneath the lithosphere. It plays a crucial role in plate tectonics, as its partially molten and ductile nature allows for the movement of tectonic plates above it.</li></ul></br>
            <dl><dt><b><u><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosphere">BIOSPHERE</a></u></b></dt></dl>
            <ul><li>The biosphere is made up of the parts of Earth where life exists—all ecosystems. The biosphere extends from the deepest root systems of trees, to the dark environments of ocean trenches, to lush rain forests, high mountaintops, and transition zones like this one, where ocean and terrestrial ecosystems meet.</li></ul></br>
            <h3 align="center"><u><b>Brief explantion about earth layers</u></b></h3>
            <p><i>Mountain ranges tower to the sky. Oceans plummet to impossible depths. Earth’s surface is an amazing place to behold. Yet even the deepest canyon is but a tiny scratch on the planet. To really understand Earth, you need to travel 6,400 kilometers (3,977 miles) beneath our feet.

Starting at the center, Earth is composed of four distinct layers. They are, from deepest to shallowest, the inner core, the outer core, the mantle and the crust. Except for the crust, no one has ever explored these layers in person. In fact, the deepest humans have ever drilled is just over 12 kilometers (7.6 miles). And even that took 20 years!

Still, scientists know a great deal about Earth’s inner structure. They’ve plumbed it by studying how earthquake waves travel through the planet. The speed and behavior of these waves change as they encounter layers of different densities. Scientists —  including Isaac Newton, three centuries ago — have also learned about the core and mantle from calculations of Earth’s total density, gravitational pull and magnetic field</i>></p>
